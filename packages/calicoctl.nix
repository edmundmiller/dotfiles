      The command line tool, calicoctl, makes it easy to manage Calico network
      and security policy, as well as other Calico configurations.
      The calicoctl command line interface provides a number of resource
      management commands to allow you to create, modify, delete, and view the
      different Calico resources. This section is a command line reference for
      calicoctl, organized based on the command hierarchy.
