Ping from NUC to Mac works (0.9ms via Tailscale), so it's a port/service/firewall issue on the Mac side. The gateway needs the Mac to run a skills-remote agent/listener that the gateway can invoke for remote tool execution. Need to figure out: 1) What service/port does skills-remote expect on the Mac? 2) How to configure it in the openclaw nix module? 3) Is there a homebrew/nix package for the skills-remote agent? This would enable the NUC gateway to delegate tool calls to the Mac.","notes":"INVESTIGATION COMPLETE:\n\n## Root Causes (3 issues found)\n\n### 1. Mac gateway launchd service is broken (BLOCKER for node)\nThe nix-openclaw module creates a launchd agent running `openclaw gateway --port 18789`, but the Mac config has `gateway.mode=remote`. Result: gateway refuses to start, spams logs: 'Gateway start blocked: set gateway.mode=local'. The `openclaw node run` command tries to connect to localhost:18789 but nothing is listening.\n\n**Fix needed**: Disable the gateway launchd on Mac (set `launchd.enable = false` in nix config) since we're in remote mode. The OpenClaw.app handles the remote connection itself.\n\n### 2. No node service running on Mac  \n`openclaw status` shows 'Node service: LaunchAgent not installed'. The node host service is what enables the NUC gateway to invoke system.run (skills-remote) on the Mac. The OpenClaw.app IS running and paired as a node, but the headless node HOST service (ai.openclaw.node launchd agent) is not installed.\n\n`openclaw node install` fails with 'Nix mode detected; service install is disabled.'\n\n**Fix needed**: Create a custom launchd agent for `openclaw node run` in the nix-darwin module. The nix-openclaw upstream module only manages gateway launchd agents, not node agents.\n\n### 3. NUC CLI commands fail (secondary issue)\nNUC CLI commands (`openclaw nodes`, etc) fail with 'Config invalid' because OPENCODE_API_KEY env var is missing. The gateway SERVICE works (env injected via ExecStartPre), but CLI invocations don't have the env. This is the 'Config invalid; doctor will run with best-effort config' error.\n\n## Proposed Fix\n1. Set `launchd.enable = false` for the Mac openclaw instance (no local gateway needed in remote mode)\n2. Add a custom launchd agent for `openclaw node run` in the Mac openclaw module\n3. The node host will connect to the local gateway — but since we don't have a local gateway, we may need to configure the node to use the remote gateway URL directly, or run a local gateway in a compatible mode","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"epic","owner":"git@edmundmiller.dev","created_at":"2026-02-16T12:31:14Z","created_by":"Edmund Miller","updated_at":"2026-02-16T13:06:42Z"}

{"id":"dotfiles-hhir","title":"bd init: leaner defaults — global gitignore + skip AGENTS.md when skill is present","description":"## Problem\n\n`bd init` has two friction points, uncovered by running it in a fresh repo.\n\n---\n\n### 1. AGENTS.md: internal contradiction\n\n`bd init` generates this AGENTS.md:\n\n```markdown\n# Agent Instructions\nThis project uses **bd** for issue tracking. Run `bd onboard` to get started.\n\n## Landing the Plane (Session Completion)\n[... 25 lines of mandatory workflow ...]\n```\n\nBut `bd onboard` itself says:\n\n\u003e Keep AGENTS.md lean while bd prime provides up-to-date workflow details.\n\nAnd outputs a 7-line stub:\n\n```markdown\n## Issue Tracking\nThis project uses bd. Run `bd prime` for workflow context...\n```\n\nAnd `bd prime` is already auto-injected at session start by the hooks that `bd init` installs.\nSo the generated AGENTS.md is:\n- Contradicted by `bd onboard`'s own advice\n- Redundant with `bd prime` (which the hooks inject automatically)\n- Redundant with the beads skill (if globally installed)\n\n**Fix**: `bd init` should write the `bd onboard` minimal stub instead of the fat AGENTS.md.\n\n---\n\n### 2. .gitignore: hooks solved this, gitignore didn't\n\nThe hooks in `.beads/hooks/` are thin shims:\n\n```sh\nexec bd hooks run pre-push \"$@\"\n```\n\nHook logic lives in bd itself. Upgrade bd, behavior upgrades everywhere. No drift.\n\nThe `.beads/.gitignore` is committed verbatim. When bd adds new runtime files (e.g. `dolt-access.lock` added post-SQLite migration), existing repos silently miss the pattern until `bd doctor` catches it. `bd doctor --fix` can update the file, but only if you think to run it.\n\n**Fix options** (increasing ambition):\n1. The pre-commit hook already runs — it could silently update `.beads/.gitignore` to current version and stage it, mirroring the shim pattern\n2. `bd upgrade` / `bd doctor --fix` auto-commits the updated `.beads/.gitignore`\n3. Make `.beads/.gitignore` itself a shim: a tiny file that `include`s a bd-managed path outside the repo (global gitignore in `~/.config/bd/gitignore`)\n\n---\n\n## Current Behavior (observed)\n\n- `bd init` creates: `.beads/` dir, `AGENTS.md` in project root, 5 hook shims, `.beads/.gitignore`\n- Root `.gitignore` is NOT modified (good — this was already fixed)\n- The hooks shim correctly — no drift risk\n- The `.beads/.gitignore` is committed verbatim — drift risk on bd upgrades\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] `bd init` generates the `bd onboard` minimal stub, not the fat landing-the-plane AGENTS.md\n- [ ] `bd init` accepts `--no-agents-md` to skip AGENTS.md entirely (e.g. when beads skill is globally installed)\n- [ ] Pre-commit hook (or `bd doctor --fix`) auto-updates `.beads/.gitignore` to current bd version patterns without prompting","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","owner":"git@edmundmiller.dev","created_at":"2026-02-21T20:33:49Z","created_by":"Edmund Miller","updated_at":"2026-02-21T20:37:48Z","labels":["upstream","ux"]}

This is what enables the NUC gateway to invoke system.run / skills-remote on the Mac.\n\n'openclaw node install' fails with 'Nix mode detected; service install is disabled.'\n\nFix: Create a custom launchd agent for 'openclaw node run' in the nix-darwin module. The upstream nix-openclaw module (github:openclaw/nix-openclaw) only manages gateway launchd agents, not node agents. Need to add a launchd.agents entry in modules/desktop/apps/openclaw/default.nix that runs 'openclaw node run' with the correct environment variables (OPENCLAW_CONFIG_PATH, OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR, OPENCLAW_NIX_MODE=1).\n\nKey question: openclaw node run tries to connect to localhost:18789 (the local gateway).
