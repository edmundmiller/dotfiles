{"id":"dotfiles-5hub","title":"OpenClaw: configure skills-remote execution from NUC gateway to Mac","description":"Gateway logs show 'skills-remote bin probe timed out (MacTraitor Pro @ 100.88.166.114)' on every startup. Ping from NUC to Mac works (0.9ms via Tailscale), so it's a port/service/firewall issue on the Mac side. The gateway needs the Mac to run a skills-remote agent/listener that the gateway can invoke for remote tool execution. Need to figure out: 1) What service/port does skills-remote expect on the Mac? 2) How to configure it in the openclaw nix module? 3) Is there a homebrew/nix package for the skills-remote agent? This would enable the NUC gateway to delegate tool calls to the Mac.","notes":"INVESTIGATION COMPLETE:\n\n## Root Causes (3 issues found)\n\n### 1. Mac gateway launchd service is broken (BLOCKER for node)\nThe nix-openclaw module creates a launchd agent running `openclaw gateway --port 18789`, but the Mac config has `gateway.mode=remote`. Result: gateway refuses to start, spams logs: 'Gateway start blocked: set gateway.mode=local'. The `openclaw node run` command tries to connect to localhost:18789 but nothing is listening.\n\n**Fix needed**: Disable the gateway launchd on Mac (set `launchd.enable = false` in nix config) since we're in remote mode. The OpenClaw.app handles the remote connection itself.\n\n### 2. No node service running on Mac  \n`openclaw status` shows 'Node service: LaunchAgent not installed'. The node host service is what enables the NUC gateway to invoke system.run (skills-remote) on the Mac. The OpenClaw.app IS running and paired as a node, but the headless node HOST service (ai.openclaw.node launchd agent) is not installed.\n\n`openclaw node install` fails with 'Nix mode detected; service install is disabled.'\n\n**Fix needed**: Create a custom launchd agent for `openclaw node run` in the nix-darwin module. The nix-openclaw upstream module only manages gateway launchd agents, not node agents.\n\n### 3. NUC CLI commands fail (secondary issue)\nNUC CLI commands (`openclaw nodes`, etc) fail with 'Config invalid' because OPENCODE_API_KEY env var is missing. The gateway SERVICE works (env injected via ExecStartPre), but CLI invocations don't have the env. This is the 'Config invalid; doctor will run with best-effort config' error.\n\n## Proposed Fix\n1. Set `launchd.enable = false` for the Mac openclaw instance (no local gateway needed in remote mode)\n2. Add a custom launchd agent for `openclaw node run` in the Mac openclaw module\n3. The node host will connect to the local gateway — but since we don't have a local gateway, we may need to configure the node to use the remote gateway URL directly, or run a local gateway in a compatible mode","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"epic","owner":"git@edmundmiller.dev","created_at":"2026-02-16T12:31:13.913833-06:00","created_by":"Edmund Miller","updated_at":"2026-02-16T13:06:42.02006-06:00"}

{"id":"dotfiles-r35e","title":"No node host service on Mac — skills-remote probe times out","description":"NUC gateway logs: 'remote bin probe timed out (MacTraitor Pro @ 100.88.166.114)'. The Mac is paired as a node (roles: [node, operator]) and the OpenClaw.app is running, but the headless node host service (ai.openclaw.node LaunchAgent) is not installed. This is what enables the NUC gateway to invoke system.run / skills-remote on the Mac.\n\n'openclaw node install' fails with 'Nix mode detected; service install is disabled.'\n\nFix: Create a custom launchd agent for 'openclaw node run' in the nix-darwin module. The upstream nix-openclaw module (github:openclaw/nix-openclaw) only manages gateway launchd agents, not node agents. Need to add a launchd.agents entry in modules/desktop/apps/openclaw/default.nix that runs 'openclaw node run' with the correct environment variables (OPENCLAW_CONFIG_PATH, OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR, OPENCLAW_NIX_MODE=1).\n\nKey question: openclaw node run tries to connect to localhost:18789 (the local gateway). In remote mode there is no local gateway. Need to determine if: (a) the node host reads gateway.remote.url when mode=remote, or (b) we need a local gateway running too, or (c) there's another config to point the node at the remote gateway directly.\n\nDepends on fixing the broken gateway launchd first (or at least understanding the architecture).\n\nFiles: modules/desktop/apps/openclaw/default.nix\nDocs: https://docs.openclaw.ai/nodes/index, https://docs.openclaw.ai/platforms/mac/xpc","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"bug","owner":"git@edmundmiller.dev","created_at":"2026-02-16T13:06:23.326272-06:00","created_by":"Edmund Miller","updated_at":"2026-02-16T13:06:23.326272-06:00","labels":["launchd","mac","nix-darwin","nuc","openclaw","skills-remote"],"dependencies":[{"issue_id":"dotfiles-r35e","depends_on_id":"dotfiles-79pa","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-02-16T13:06:36.681331-06:00","created_by":"Edmund Miller"},{"issue_id":"dotfiles-r35e","depends_on_id":"dotfiles-5hub","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2026-02-16T13:06:36.929984-06:00","created_by":"Edmund Miller"}]}
