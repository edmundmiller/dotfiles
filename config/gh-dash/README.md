# GitHub Dashboard Configuration

This directory contains the GitHub Dashboard (`gh-dash`) configuration with **Graphite-inspired features**, providing a powerful TUI for managing PRs and issues across multiple repositories with priority inbox organization and stacked PR support.

## Overview

gh-dash is a GitHub CLI extension that displays a configurable dashboard of pull requests and issues. This configuration is optimized for:

- **Graphite-style priority inbox** - Organized by review status and urgency
- **Stacked PR workflow** - Track dependent PRs and branch relationships
- **jj-spr integration** - Native support for jujutsu stacked PR workflows
- **Multi-org management** - Work across nf-core, Seqera, Applied Genomics, and Nextflow

## Quick Start

```bash
# Launch the dashboard
gh dash

# Launch with specific config (if needed)
gh dash --config ~/.config/gh-dash/config.yml
```

## Priority Inbox Sections (Graphite-Inspired)

The dashboard implements a Graphite-style priority inbox that organizes PRs by urgency and status:

### Immediate Action Required

| Section                      | Purpose                                   | Filters                                     |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| 🚨 Needs My Review (Urgent)  | PRs awaiting review (updated in last 24h) | `review-requested:@me updated:>24h`         |
| 🔄 Changes Requested         | Your PRs requiring updates                | `author:@me review:changes_requested`       |
| ✅ Approved & Ready to Merge | PRs ready to ship                         | `author:@me review:approved status:success` |

### Stacked PR Tracking

gh-dash now includes dedicated sections for managing stacked PRs:

| Section                         | Purpose                       | Filters                              |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| 📚 My Stacks (Base Branch main) | Root PRs in your stacks       | `author:@me base:main`               |
| 🔗 Dependent PRs (Stacked)      | PRs based on feature branches | `author:@me -base:main -base:master` |
| 🌲 Stack Activity               | Recently updated stack PRs    | `author:@me updated:>48h`            |

**Stacked PR Workflow:**

1. View your base PRs in "📚 My Stacks"
2. Track dependent PRs in "🔗 Dependent PRs"
3. Use `S` key to view stack status
4. Use `ctrl+s` to see branch relationships
5. Use `J` to land PRs with jj-spr

### Integration

- **Diff viewer**: Uses `delta` for beautiful diffs
- **Clipboard**: Configured for `pbcopy` (macOS)
- **Browser**: Opens with `open` command (macOS)
- **jj-spr**: Native integration for stacked workflows

## Theme

Uses **Catppuccin Mocha** colors to match your terminal theme:

- Primary text: `#cdd6f4`
- Secondary text: `#a6adc8`
- Selected background: `#45475a`
- Borders: `#6c7086`
- Success: `#a6e3a1`
- Warning: `#f9e2af`

## Troubleshooting

### Config Not Loading

```bash
# Verify config location
echo $GH_DASH_CONFIG
ls -la ~/.config/gh-dash/

# Force specific config
gh dash --config ~/.config/gh-dash/config.yml
```

### Keybindings Not Working

- Ensure GitHub CLI is authenticated: `gh auth status`
- Check that commands work manually: `gh pr list`
- Verify repository access permissions

### jj-spr Commands Failing

- Ensure jj-spr is installed: `which jj-spr`
- Check you're in a jj repository: `jj status`
- Verify repository path mapping in config

### Repository Checkout Failing

- Verify repository exists locally at mapped path
- Check path patterns in `repoPaths` section
- Ensure repository is cloned: `ls ~/src/<org>/<repo>`

### Theme Issues

- Terminal must support 24-bit color
- Ensure terminal theme doesn't override colors
- Check `$TERM` environment variable

## Comparison to Graphite

This configuration replicates many of Graphite's key features:

| Feature             | Graphite    | gh-dash       | Implementation                |
| ------------------- | ----------- | ------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **Priority Inbox**  | ✅ Native   | ✅ Yes        | Dedicated sections by status  |
| **Stacked PRs**     | ✅ Native   | ✅ Via jj-spr | Sections + jj-spr integration |
| **Quick Actions**   | ✅ Yes      | ✅ Yes        | Rich keybindings              |
| **Multi-repo**      | ✅ Yes      | ✅ Yes        | Organization filters          |
| **Custom Sections** | ✅ Yes      | ✅ Yes        | GitHub search syntax          |
| **Local Checkout**  | ✅ Yes      | ✅ Yes        | Path mapping + `O` key        |
| **Team Sharing**    | ✅ Built-in | ✅ Via git    | Share config files            |
| **AI Review**       | ✅ Premium  | ❌ No         | Use external tools            |
| **Analytics**       | ✅ Yes      | ❌ No         | Use GitHub Insights           |

**Advantages over Graphite:**

- ✅ Fully terminal-native (no context switching)
- ✅ No external service dependency (privacy)
- ✅ More powerful filtering (GitHub search syntax)
- ✅ Completely customizable keybindings
- ✅ Free and open-source
- ✅ Integrates with existing jj-spr workflow

## Customization

The configuration is managed through nix-darwin. To modify:

1. Edit `/Users/edmundmiller/.config/dotfiles/config/gh-dash/config.yml`
2. Run `hey rebuild` to update symlinks
3. Restart gh-dash to apply changes

### Adding New Sections

```yaml
prSections:
  - title: "🎯 New Section"
    filters: "is:open your-filters-here"
    limit: 20
    layout:
      author:
        width: 15
```

### Custom Keybindings

```yaml
keybindings:
  prs:
    - key: "your-key"
      name: "action name"
      command: "gh command {{.PrNumber}} {{.RepoName}}"
```

### Advanced Filtering

Use GitHub's full search syntax:

- Time filters: `updated:>={{ nowModify "-3d" }}`
- Logical operators: `-author:@me` (negation)
- Combined filters: `org:nf-core label:bug status:failure`
- Sort options: `sort:reactions-desc`, `sort:comments-desc`

## Tips

1. **Master the priority inbox**: Start each day with "🚨 Needs My Review"
2. **Leverage stacked sections**: Use "📚 My Stacks" to track complex work
3. **Use quick actions**: `a`, `m`, and `O` are your friends
4. **Copy URLs freely**: `y` makes sharing easy in Slack/email
5. **Preview mode**: Keep preview open to scan PR details quickly
6. **jj-spr integration**: Use `J` and `ctrl+j` for stack management
7. **Watch for staleness**: Check "💤 Stale PRs" weekly
8. **Org-specific focus**: Navigate directly to relevant org sections
