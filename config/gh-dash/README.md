# GitHub Dashboard Configuration

This directory contains the GitHub Dashboard (`gh-dash`) configuration that provides a powerful TUI for managing PRs and issues across multiple repositories and organizations.

## Overview

gh-dash is a GitHub CLI extension that displays a configurable dashboard of pull requests and issues. This configuration is optimized for managing work across multiple organizations including nf-core, seqeralabs, Applied-Genomics-UTD, and personal projects.

**Configuration Philosophy**: This setup follows best practices from "CLI-Based GitHub PR Review Tools: A Practical Guide" for high-volume PR workflows, combining gh-dash's superior triage capabilities with Neovim's deep review interface. The optimal workflow: discover and prioritize in gh-dash, then dive deep in the editor.

## Files

- `config.yml` - Main configuration file with sections, keybindings, and theme
- `README.md` - This documentation file

## Quick Start

```bash
# Launch the dashboard
gh dash

# Launch with specific config (if needed)
gh dash --config ~/.config/gh-dash/config.yml
```

## PR Sections

The dashboard is organized into focused sections for different types of work, following SLA-based prioritization (urgent <2h, high priority <4h, normal <24h):

| Section | Purpose | Filters | Priority |
|---------|---------|---------|----------|
| 🚨 Urgent - Needs My Review | Critical PRs requiring immediate attention | `review-requested:@me label:urgent` | <2 hours |
| 📝 My Open PRs | Your active work | `author:@me` | Monitor |
| 👁️ Needs My Review | PRs awaiting your review | `review-requested:@me` | <4 hours |
| 🔄 Recently Updated | PRs with activity in the last week | `involves:@me updated:>=-1w` | Review |
| 🚧 Draft PRs | Work in progress | `is:draft author:@me` | Monitor |
| 🧬 nf-core PRs | nf-core ecosystem work | `org:nf-core involves:@me` | <24 hours |
| ⚡ Nextflow PRs | Core Nextflow work | `org:nextflow-io involves:@me` | <24 hours |
| 🎓 Applied Genomics PRs | Student/teaching work | `org:Applied-Genomics-UTD` | <24 hours |
| 🏢 Seqera PRs | Seqera platform work | `org:seqeralabs involves:@me` | <24 hours |
| 🤖 Dependabot PRs | Automated updates | `author:app/dependabot involves:@me` | <48 hours |

## Issue Sections

| Section | Purpose | Filters |
|---------|---------|---------|
| 🐛 My Issues | Issues you created | `author:@me` |
| ✅ Assigned to Me | Issues assigned to you | `assignee:@me` |
| 🧬 nf-core Issues | nf-core ecosystem issues | `org:nf-core involves:@me` |

## Workflow Examples

### Optimal Workflow: gh-dash + Neovim (Recommended)
This setup implements the **optimal strategy from the CLI PR tools guide**: use gh-dash for queue management and discovery, then dive deep in Neovim for detailed review.

1. Launch `gh dash`
2. Navigate to "🚨 Urgent" or "👁️ Needs My Review" section
3. Press `C` on a PR to open it in Neovim with gh.nvim in a new tmux window
4. Review the PR in the editor with full LSP support and context
5. Return to gh-dash, press `a` to approve or `r` to request changes
6. Manage 3-5 PRs in parallel using tmux windows

**Benefits**:
- Combines gh-dash's superior triage with Neovim's deep review interface
- tmux integration enables parallel PR reviews without context switching
- Full LSP functionality (go-to-definition, find-references) on PR code
- No browser required for entire workflow

### Morning Review Routine
1. Launch `gh dash`
2. Check "🚨 Urgent" section first (SLA: <2 hours)
3. Check "👁️ Needs My Review" section (SLA: <4 hours)
4. Use `a` to quickly approve straightforward PRs (<200 lines)
5. Use `C` to open complex PRs in Neovim for deep review
6. Use `d` to quickly view diffs without full checkout

### PR Management
1. Review "📝 My Open PRs" for status updates
2. Use `m` to merge approved PRs
3. Use `R` to mark drafts as ready
4. Monitor "🤖 Dependabot PRs" for updates

### Organization Work
1. Check org-specific sections (nf-core, Seqera, etc.)
2. Use `y` to copy URLs for sharing
3. Use `@` to assign issues to yourself
4. Use `c` to add comments and feedback

## Troubleshooting

### Config Not Loading
```bash
# Verify config location
echo $GH_DASH_CONFIG
ls -la ~/.config/gh-dash/

# Force specific config
gh dash --config ~/.config/gh-dash/config.yml
```

### Keybindings Not Working
- Ensure GitHub CLI is authenticated: `gh auth status`
- Check that commands work manually: `gh pr list`
- Verify repository access permissions

### Theme Issues
- Terminal must support 24-bit color
- Ensure terminal theme doesn't override colors
- Check `$TERM` environment variable

## Customization

The configuration is managed through nix-darwin. To modify:

1. Edit `/Users/emiller/.config/dotfiles/config/gh-dash/config.yml`
2. Run `hey rebuild` to update symlinks
3. Restart gh-dash to apply changes

### Adding New Sections
```yaml
prSections:
  - title: "🎯 New Section"
    filters: "is:open your-filters-here"
    type: null
```

### Custom Keybindings
```yaml
keybindings:
  prs:
    - key: "your-key"
      name: "action name"
      command: "your-command-here"
```

## Tips

1. **Use filters effectively**: Combine `org:`, `repo:`, and `involves:@me` for focused views
2. **Leverage sorting**: Use `sort:updated-desc` for recent activity, `sort:reactions-desc` for popular items
3. **Quick actions**: Master `a`, `m`, `C`, and `O` for common operations
4. **Preview mode**: Keep preview open to quickly scan PR details
5. **Copy URLs**: Use `y` to easily share PRs in Slack/email
6. **tmux workflow**: Use `C` keybinding to review 3-5 PRs in parallel tmux windows
7. **SLA awareness**: Prioritize based on urgency (urgent <2h, high <4h, normal <24h)

## Best Practices from the Guide

### PR Size Guidelines
- **Small PRs** (<200 lines): Same-day reviews, 15-30 minutes - use `a` for quick approval
- **Medium PRs** (200-500 lines): 1-2 hours - use `C` to review in Neovim with full context
- **Large PRs** (>500 lines): Should be rare - request splitting into stacked PRs

### Review Workflow
1. **Triage in gh-dash**: Use dashboard to prioritize and categorize PRs
2. **Deep review in Neovim**: Press `C` for complex PRs requiring code context
3. **Quick actions for simple PRs**: Use `a` for obvious approvals
4. **Check CI status**: Press `s` before reviewing to ensure tests pass
5. **Parallel reviews**: Manage multiple PRs simultaneously in tmux windows

### Managing High Volume
- Track metrics: Aim for 1-2 review rounds per PR
- Review load: 3-5 PRs max in review simultaneously
- Use "🔄 Recently Updated" section to catch PRs needing re-review
- Leverage the "🚨 Urgent" section for critical items

This configuration transforms GitHub management from a context-switching web workflow into an efficient terminal-based process optimized for high-volume PR workflows.
