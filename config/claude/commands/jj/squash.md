### Changes ready to squash:
!`jj diff --summary`

### What squashing does:
- Moves your implementation from current commit ‚Üí parent commit
- Creates clean, focused commit ready for review/push
- Completes the squash workflow cycle
- Working copy moves to the parent (now containing your work)

**Remember**: This is the final step that creates your polished commit!
