## Safety Net üõ°Ô∏è

**Everything in jj is undoable!** No operation is ever truly destructive.

### Common Recovery Scenarios:

‚ùå **Accidental squash**: `jj undo`
‚ùå **Wrong split**: `jj undo`
‚ùå **Bad rebase**: `jj undo`
‚ùå **Mistaken abandon**: `jj undo`
‚ùå **Wrong edit**: `jj undo`
‚ùå **Any mistake**: `jj undo` or `jj op restore <id>`

### Understanding Operations:

Every action creates an operation:
- `describe` - Sets commit messages
- `new` - Creates changes
- `squash` - Moves changes between commits
- `split` - Divides commits
- `rebase` - Reorganizes history
- `abandon` - Removes commits

### Safety Philosophy:

üîÑ **You can undo an undo**: If `jj undo` goes too far, just `jj undo` again
‚è∞ **Time travel**: Jump to any point with `jj op restore`
üìö **Complete history**: `jj op log` shows everything you've ever done
üõ°Ô∏è **No data loss**: Even "destructive" operations are preserved

### Current state:
!`jj status`

**Remember**: In jj, "oops" is never permanent. When in doubt, just undo!
