## The Edit Workflow üîß **ADVANCED**

**Pattern**: Dynamic navigation and insertion between changes

Best for complex features requiring multiple related commits or when you need to insert changes mid-history.

## Current Status
!`jj status`
!`jj log -r ::@ --limit 5 --no-graph`

## Intelligent Operations

  echo "‚úÖ **Good for:**"
  echo "- Complex features needing multiple commits"
  echo "- When you discover prerequisites mid-development"
  echo "- Refactoring existing change sequences"
  echo "- Building layered functionality"
  echo ""
  echo "‚ùå **Avoid for:**"
  echo "- Simple, single-focused changes (use squash workflow)"
  echo "- Linear development without dependencies"
  echo "- When you're unsure of the final structure"
  echo ""
  echo "### Quick Operations:"
  echo "- \`@edit-workflow start\` - Begin complex feature"
  echo "- \`@edit-workflow insert\` - Add prerequisite change"
  echo "- \`@edit-workflow navigate\` - Move between changes"
  echo "- \`@edit-workflow example\` - See complete example"
  echo "- \`@edit-workflow <change-id>\` - Edit specific change"

### Key Advantages:

- **Automatic rebasing**: Dependencies update automatically
- **Flexible insertion**: Add changes anywhere in history
- **Independent editing**: Modify any change without affecting others
- **Clear structure**: Each commit represents a logical unit

**Remember**: The edit workflow excels when you need fine-grained control over commit structure.
