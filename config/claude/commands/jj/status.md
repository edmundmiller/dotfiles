## Repository Status with Context

Get a comprehensive view of your current state and suggested next actions.

## Current State
!`jj status`

## Change History Context
!`jj log -r ::@ --limit 5 --no-graph`

## Workflow Analysis

!# Analyze current state and provide guidance
current_desc=$(jj log -r @ -T description --no-graph 2>/dev/null || echo "")
has_changes=$(jj status --no-pager 2>/dev/null | grep -E "^[AM]" || echo "")
parent_desc=$(jj log -r @- -T description --no-graph 2>/dev/null || echo "")

## Recent Operations
!echo ""
echo "### Recent Operations (undoable)"
jj op log --limit 3

## Branches
!echo ""
echo "### Branch Status"
jj branch list

## Quick Actions

Based on your current state, here are the most relevant commands:

### Workflow Commands:
- `@squash-workflow` - Complete squash workflow guidance
- `@edit-workflow` - Advanced multi-commit workflow
- `@squash` - Complete current work
- `@describe` - Add/update commit message

### Navigation:
- `@navigate` - Move between changes
- `@undo` - Undo last operation

### Safety:
- `jj op log` - See all operations (everything is undoable)
- `jj diff` - See current changes
- `jj show` - Review current commit

**Remember**: Every operation in jj is undoable. Use `@undo` or `jj op restore` for safety.
