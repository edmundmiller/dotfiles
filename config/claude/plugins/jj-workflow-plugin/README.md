# Jujutsu Workflow Plugin

Autonomous commit stacking and curation for Jujutsu (jj). Provides Claude Code with slash commands, Skills, and hooks for stack-based commit workflows.

**Features:** Slash commands (`/jj:commit`, `/jj:split`, `/jj:squash`, `/jj:cleanup`), Agent Skills (workflow understanding, commit curation, message generation), Git translation hook, Plan-driven workflow, Auto-formatting (`jj fix`), Automatic file tracking

## Commands

### `/jj:commit [message]`

Stack commit with intelligent message generation. Auto-generates from changes or uses explicit message. Tracks new files automatically. Supports conventional commit format.

### `/jj:split <pattern>`

Split commit by pattern. Common: `test`, `docs`, `config`, or custom globs like `"*.md"`. Moves matched files to parent commit.

### `/jj:squash [revision]`

Merge commits in stack. Use for WIP commits or combining related changes before sharing.

### `/jj:cleanup`

Remove empty jj workspaces.

## Quick Start

```bash
/jj:commit "feat: add login UI"      # Stack commits (files tracked automatically)
/jj:split test                       # Separate tests from implementation
/jj:squash                           # Merge WIP commits
jj op log                            # See all operations (everything undoable)
```

## Key Principles

Stack commits, pattern-based splits, leverage snapshots (`jj op log`), everything undoable, curate before sharing

## Agent Skills

Three auto-activating Skills provide jj workflow understanding:

**1. Working with Jujutsu** - Core concepts, state management, plan-driven workflow, command suggestions
**2. Curating Commits** - Pattern recognition for splits/squashes, file type matching, avoiding over-curation
**3. Generating Messages** - Conventional commit format, project style matching, auto-generation from patterns

Skills activate automatically based on context. Slash commands require explicit user invocation.

## Integration

**Automatic Snapshotting:** Every operation in `jj op log`, use `jj op restore` for time travel

**Hooks:**

- **Plan-Driven:** Creates "plan:" commit for substantial tasks, validates at session end
- **Git Translation:** Intercepts git commands, suggests jj equivalents
- **Auto-formatting:** Runs `jj fix -s @` after edits
- **Session Validation:** Detects plan commits with work, suggests description updates

**Git translation:** `git status` → `jj st`, `git commit` → `jj commit`, `git log` → `jj log`, `git checkout` → `jj new`, etc.

**hunk.nvim:** Works as diff editor for interactive splitting

## Installation

Part of dotfiles configuration. To use in other projects: Copy plugin directory to `.claude/plugins/jj-workflow-plugin/`

## Requirements

Jujutsu (jj) installed, Claude Code v1.0.88+, basic jj familiarity

## Troubleshooting

**Commands not showing:** Verify `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` exists, check `which jj`
**Not a jj repo:** Run `jj git init --colocate` or `jj init`
**Git blocked:** Expected behavior - hook redirects git → jj
**Hook issues:** Verify executable (`chmod +x`), check `which uv`
