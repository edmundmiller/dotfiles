# Curating Jujutsu Commits

## When to Curate

**Suggest curation:**

- Before sharing work (PR, pushing)
- Commits mix unrelated concerns (tests+code, docs+code, config+code)
- WIP, fixup, or temporary commits present

**Don't suggest when:**

- Changes simple and focused
- Single commit, one concern
- Early exploration phase

## Split Patterns

Use `/jj:split <pattern>` when mixing concerns:

**Tests + implementation:**

```
Your changes include both implementation and tests. Consider:
/jj:split test
```

**Docs + code:**

```
Your changes mix code and documentation. Consider:
/jj:split docs
```

**Config + features:**

```
Your changes include configuration. Consider:
/jj:split config
```

**Common patterns:** `test`, `docs`, `config`, `*.{ext}`, custom globs

## Squash Patterns

Use `/jj:squash` when combining commits:

**Multiple WIP commits:**

```
You have multiple WIP commits for same feature. Consider:
/jj:squash
```

Indicators: "WIP", "wip", "fixup", "temp", "checkpoint" messages

**Fixup commits:**

```
This looks like a fixup for your previous commit. Consider:
/jj:squash
```

Indicators: "fix typo", "fix tests", "fix formatting" messages

**Related small changes:**

```
These commits are closely related. Consider:
/jj:squash
```

Indicators: Same feature/scope, same work session

## Curation Workflow

1. Review stack: `jj log`
2. Split mixed concerns: `/jj:split <pattern>`
3. Squash WIP commits: `/jj:squash`
4. Verify: `jj log`, `jj diff -r <commit>`
5. Update descriptions: `/jj:commit` or `jj describe`

## Avoiding Over-Curation

**Don't suggest when:**

- Single purpose changes (all files work toward one goal)
- Tightly coupled changes (splitting breaks logical cohesion)
- Already atomic (commit focused and clear)
- Early exploration phase

**Good single commits:** "Refactor auth module", "Add user profile page" (template+route+tests), "Fix memory leak" (investigation+fix)

## TodoWrite Integration

One commit per major todo completion. Use `jj new` between todos. Don't suggest splitting if commits already align with todo structure.

## When This Skill Activates

- Multiple commits to organize
- Changes mix file types or concerns
- User mentions preparing for PR/sharing
- WIP or fixup commits present
- User asks about organizing commits
- Before suggesting pushing or creating PRs
