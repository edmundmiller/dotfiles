# Critical Instructions

- **ALWAYS write over the source file you're editing.** Don't make "\_enhanced", "\_fixed", "\_updated", or "\_v2" versions. We use JJ for version control. If unsure, commit first then overwrite.
- Don't make "dashboards" or figures with a lot of plots in one image file. It's hard for AIs to figure out what all is going on.
- **Automatically use context7 for code generation and library documentation.** When working with code examples, setup steps, configuration, or library/API documentation, proactively use context7 tools to provide accurate, up-to-date information.
