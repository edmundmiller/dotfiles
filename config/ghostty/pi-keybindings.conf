# Ghostty keybindings for pi coding agent
# https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/tree/main/packages/coding-agent

# Alt+Backspace - send proper escape sequence for word deletion
keybind = alt+backspace=text:\x1b\x7f

# Shift+Enter - send literal newline
# NOTE: This conflicts with OpenCode's shift+enter binding in keybindings.conf
# which sends CSI u sequence (\x1b[13;2u). If you use both tools, comment out
# the one you don't need, or choose which behavior you prefer:
#   - Pi: literal newline (\n)
#   - OpenCode: CSI u sequence for proper key detection (\x1b[13;2u)
keybind = shift+enter=text:\n
