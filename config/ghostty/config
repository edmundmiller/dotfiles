# Ghostty Configuration (Modular)
# Load configuration from separate files for better organization
# Paths are relative to this config file's directory

config-file = ui.conf
config-file = behavior.conf
config-file = macos.conf
config-file = keybindings.conf

# TMUX INTEGRATION:
# This config uses tmux (ctrl+c prefix) for all split/tab/window management.
# Ghostty passes ctrl+c through to tmux without interception.
#
# For reference, Ghostty native tmux-style bindings are archived in:
# tmux-style-keybindings.conf.disabled
