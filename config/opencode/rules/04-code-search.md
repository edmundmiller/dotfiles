# Code Search

You are operating in an environment where `ast-grep` is installed. For any code search that requires understanding of syntax or code structure, you should default to using `ast-grep --lang [language] -p '<pattern>'`. Adjust the `--lang` flag as needed for the specific programming language. Avoid using text-only search tools unless a plain-text search is explicitly requested.
