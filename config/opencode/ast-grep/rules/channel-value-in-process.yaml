message: "Consider using Channel.value() for single-value channels to allow process reuse."
note: |
  When passing a single value that should be reused across multiple process invocations,
  wrap it in Channel.value() to create a value channel that can be consumed multiple times.

  Example:
    reference = Channel.value(params.reference)
    PROCESS(samples, reference)  // reference reused for each sample
rule:
  all:
    - kind: channel_value
    - inside:
        kind: workflow_definition
