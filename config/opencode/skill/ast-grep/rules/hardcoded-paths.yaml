message: "Avoid hardcoded absolute paths. Use params, projectDir, or launchDir instead."
note: |
  Hardcoded paths reduce portability. Use:
  - params.input for user-configurable paths
  - projectDir for paths relative to the pipeline
  - launchDir for paths relative to where pipeline was launched
  - workDir for work directory paths
rule:
  regex: '"/(?:home|usr|opt|data|scratch|tmp)/[^"]*"'
