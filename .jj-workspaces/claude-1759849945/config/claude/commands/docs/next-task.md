Complete the next task from the plan in docs/start-here.md

Please look at docs/start-here.md and follow the instructions. Your job is to get the next task done. Ultimately, you are the one guiding the work and making sure it meets what it's supposed to do. Chunk the work into small pieces, when it's helpful.

First, review the necessary files, think carefully, review more, and then create a plan to create the next chunk of work. Output your plan for approval by me (the user) before proceeding. Pause after outputting the plan to wait for my input.

Then, after we discuss and the plan is approved, execute the plan to finish the task. Use subagents when helpful. Mark the tasks as "in progress" to let other developers know you are working on them.

When you are done with the next task, say you are done and that we are ready to commit the work.

If I want you to work on a *specific* task instead of the *next* task, I will include that information right here: $ARGUMENTS
