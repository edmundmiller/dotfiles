Update task documentation with current state

Before continuing our work, please update our task documentation (`docs/tasks/` dir docs) to get them up to date with the current state of progress. Please mark as completed tasks that we've done together (quickly double-check that the task is *actually* done before marking it as complete in the tasks docs), and make sure that any upcoming tasks we've discussed are added/reflected as tasks in the appropriate place in the docs, if they're not already there. We want to leave the task docs in a state where any future new developer could pick up where we left off and have full information needed to continue the tasks.

After updating the task documentation, remind me of where we were and what we were about to do next, then pause.
